This project is created to work as an app to take orders, process them, give an order total, maintain a .txt file where username, password and balance of the user is maintained. The "login page allows a new user to create account and then login. After logging in, the user can select what to eat from a menu list that can be modified internally by the cafeteria and after placing the order, the user who was assigned with a initial balance of $100 gets a balance deduction and the new balance is recorded as current balance in the previous .txt file
